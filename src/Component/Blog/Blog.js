                <h3>Does President Obama’s 2nd Inauguration Have Anything To Do With Spanish?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>(PRWEB) January 20, 2013 Some believe that part of President Obama’s win came after wooing the Spanish vote. Back in 2008, President Obama began to reach out to Hispanics as he said, campaigning to English speakers, “You need to make sure your child can speak Spanish,” and that, “we should have every child speaking more than one language.” Next, in 2012, President Obama not only outspent Mitt Romney reaching out to Hispanic voters, he had more widely accepted policies on immigration. He also took the time to practice Spanish, and with a surprisingly good Spanish accent, campaigned directly to Hispanics. It comes as no surprise that President Obama did so well among Hispanic voters and won a second term. “We’re honored to have a President who puts such an emphasis on language learning and …</p>

If people can get encyclopedias, dictionaries, personalized music, children’s learning games and video games free on the internet, there is no reason that language learning shouldn’t be free as well,” remarked Dave Clark, CEO of LearnALanguage.com.

                <h3>Why I’m Thankful for Learning English</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Every year around Thanksgiving I take time to reflect about the things for which I am thankful. You can bet that I am grateful for the opportunity to learn Spanish. Learning Spanish has opened doors and provided me with opportunities I would not otherwise have. I met a Guatemalan man in Boston, Massachusetts on a work visa. His name is Eric Quixaj, and he became one of my great friends. We were able to take part in some service activities together and he has a giant heart. He has since returned to Guatemala and I have been unable to contact him, but the memories remain.
